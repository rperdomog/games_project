## Data manipulation

In the following project there is available a dataset with data collected for certain video games for several years. We just want to focus our data analysis for the year 2016, to get insights and the better decisions for the year 2017.

In that order the first action is to filter all the information collected in 2016, and after that, check data types, missing values to decide how to conduct our analysis.
